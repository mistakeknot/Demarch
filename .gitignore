# Interverse monorepo .gitignore
# Each subproject has its own .git — ignore them all here.
# Only the monorepo skeleton, beads, and shared docs are tracked.

# ── Subproject directories (each has its own repo) ──
hub/
plugins/
services/
infra/

# ── Beads runtime artifacts (beads' own .gitignore handles the rest) ──
.beads/bd.sock.startlock
.beads/daemon-error

# ── Claude Code session artifacts ──
.claude/settings.local.json
.claude/*.log

# ── Stale symlinks ──
