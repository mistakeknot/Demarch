# Signs of AI Writing -- Exhaustive Reference

Extracted from Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" page (WP:AISIGNS / WP:AITELLS / WP:LLMSIGNS). This is a field guide originally created for detecting undisclosed AI-generated content on Wikipedia, but many signs are broadly applicable.

Source: Wikipedia wikitext dump (592 lines, truncated -- the original page likely contains additional sections beyond "Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers"). Last extracted: 2026-02-24.

**Note:** The file was truncated mid-sentence at "Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers and speculation about gaps in sources." Sections that likely exist beyond the truncation point (based on the Table of Contents and common structure of the original page) include: Abrupt cut-offs, Use of Markdown, Hallucinated citations/references, and Technical formatting tells. This document covers everything present in the available text.

---

## 3. Content Patterns

### 3.1 Undue Emphasis on Significance, Legacy, and Broader Trends
- Puffs up importance by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects represent or contribute to a broader topic
- Uses a distinct, identifiable repertoire of phrases for these statements
- Applied even to the most mundane subjects (etymology, population data)
- Sometimes adds hedging preambles acknowledging the subject is unimportant, then talks about its importance anyway
- For biology topics: over-emphasizes connections to broader ecosystem/environment, even when tenuous
- Belabors conservation status and preservation efforts even when unknown or nonexistent

### 3.2 Undue Emphasis on Notability, Attribution, and Media Coverage
- Lists sources a subject has been covered in, with or without context about what those sources actually said
- Inaccurately attributes the LLM's own superficial analyses to named sources
- Creates entire "Media coverage" sections listing sources in bullet format
- Painstakingly emphasizes sources in body text even for trivial coverage or uncontroversial facts
- Notes that subjects "maintain an active social media presence"
- Echoes the exact wording of Wikipedia's notability guidelines (e.g., "independent coverage")
- More common in text from newer AI tools (2025+)

### 3.3 Superficial Analyses
- Inserts superficial analysis, often about significance, recognition, or impact
- Attaches present-participle ("-ing") phrases at end of sentences
- Uses vague attributions to third parties
- Newer chatbots with RAG may attach these to named sources regardless of whether those sources say anything close
- On Wikipedia, such comments are usually synthesis and/or unattributed opinions

### 3.4 Outline-Like Conclusions About Challenges and Future Prospects
- Formulaic "Challenges" section near end of article
- Begins with "Despite its [positive words], [subject] faces challenges..."
- Ends with vaguely positive assessment or speculation about potential initiatives
- May include separate "Future Prospects" section
- Rigid outline structure throughout article

### 3.5 Leads Treating Article Titles as Proper Nouns
- Introduces non-proper-noun article titles (especially lists) as if they were standalone real-world entities
- Example: '"The Effects of Foreign language anxiety on Learning" refers to...'
- Example: '"List of songs about Mexico" is a curated compilation...'

### 3.6 Vague See-Also Sections
- Fills "see also" sections with overly broad terms
- Example: linking to "Financial technology" from a startup article
- May link to non-existent articles or leave terms unlinked

---

## 4. Language and Grammar Patterns

### 4.1 Overused AI Vocabulary Words
(See Section 1 for the complete word list)
- Words that appeared far more frequently in text post-2023 than pre-2023
- They often co-occur: where there is one, there are likely others
- Distribution varies slightly by chatbot/LLM used
- Has changed over time (e.g., "delve" dropped sharply in 2025)
- One of the strongest tells for AI use when many appear together

### 4.2 Avoidance of Basic Copulatives ("is"/"are")
- Substitutes "serves as a" or "marks the" for simpler "is" or "are" constructions
- Prefers "features," "offers," etc. over neutral "has"
- Over 10% decrease in "is" and "are" usage in academic writing in 2023 (documented by Geng/Trotta)
- Particularly visible in AI copyedits, which "improve" text this way
- More elaborate variants: "ventured into politics as a candidate" vs "was a candidate"

### 4.3 Negative Parallelisms
- Overuses "Not only ... but ..." constructions
- "It is not just about ..., it's ..." patterns
- "It's not ..., it's ..." or "no ..., no ..., just ..." patterns
- Assumes the reader is reaching an incorrect conclusion and attempts to challenge it
- Can span multiple sentences: "[positive quality], however, [counterpoint]"

### 4.4 Rule of Three
- Overuses the rhetorical "rule of three"
- Forms: "adjective, adjective, adjective" or "short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase"
- Often used to make superficial analyses appear more comprehensive
- Example: "global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers"
- Example: "keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities"

### 4.5 Elegant Variation (Repetition Penalty Artifacts)
- Avoids reusing words due to built-in repetition-penalty code
- Substitutes synonyms or related terms for previously used words (e.g., character name -> "protagonist" -> "key player" -> "eponymous character")
- Creates unnatural variation where consistency would be clearer
- Multiple closely related concepts get different phrasings each time they recur in a passage
- May not apply to content generated in separate sessions/edits

### 4.6 False Ranges
- Uses "from ... to ..." constructions where no meaningful scale exists
- The endpoints are loosely related or unrelated things
- No coherent middle ground can be identified between the endpoints
- Done because such language is used in persuasive writing to impress
- Example: "from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web" (no scale)
- Example: "from fundamental physics to medicine and neuroscience" (different fields, not a spectrum)

---

## 5. Style and Formatting Patterns

### 5.1 Title Case in Section Headings
- Capitalizes all main words in section headings
- Example: "Global Context: Critical Mineral Demand" instead of "Global context: critical mineral demand"
- Example: "Strategic Negotiations and Global Partnerships"
- Example: "High-Stakes Deals: Glencore, China, and Russia"

### 5.2 Overuse of Boldface
- Bolds various phrases for emphasis in excessive, mechanical manner
- Emphasizes every instance of a chosen word or phrase
- "Key takeaways" fashion inherited from READMEs, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles
- Example: bolding every acronym definition in body text
- Example: bolding subject-matter terms throughout body text
- Some newer LLMs have instructions to avoid this

### 5.3 Inline-Header Vertical Lists
- Bullet/numbered lists where each item has a boldfaced inline header followed by a colon, then descriptive text
- Uses bullet characters, hyphens, en dashes, hashes, or emoji instead of proper wikitext list markup
- Ordered lists with explicit numbers (e.g., "1.") instead of standard markup
- Formatting information lost when copied as bare text
- Line breaks may be lost, creating run-on text

### 5.4 Emoji in Content
- Decorates section headings or bullet points with emoji
- Most noticeable in discussion/talk page comments
- Example: emoji-prefixed section headers (brain, bricks, siren, compass, etc.)
- Example: emoji-prefixed chronological list entries

### 5.5 Overuse of Em Dashes
- Uses em dashes more often than human nonprofessional writers of the same genre
- Uses them where humans would use commas, parentheses, colons, or hyphens
- Formulaic, pat usage mimicking "punched up" sales-like writing
- Over-emphasizes clauses or parallelisms
- More common on discussion pages than in article text
- Some AI companies have attempted to suppress this in newer models (notably OpenAI's GPT-5.1)
- Most useful as an indicator when combined with other tells

### 5.6 Unusual Use of Tables
- Creates unnecessary small tables that could be better represented as prose
- Tables for data that would be more naturally expressed in sentences
- Example: 3-row "Key Statistics" tables with heterogeneous data types

### 5.7 Curly Quotation Marks and Apostrophes
- ChatGPT and DeepSeek typically use curly quotes ("...") instead of straight quotes ("...")
- Uses curly apostrophe (right single quotation mark) instead of straight apostrophe
- May use them inconsistently (mixing curly and straight in same response)
- **Not unique to AI:** Microsoft Word, macOS, iOS smart quotes, LanguageTool also produce curly quotes
- **Notable exception:** Gemini and Claude models typically do NOT use curly quotes

### 5.8 Subject Lines
- Messages/requests begin with "Subject: ..." as if intended for an email form
- Example: "Subject: Request for Permission to Edit Wikipedia Article"
- Example: "Subject: Request for Review and Clarification Regarding Draft Article"

### 5.9 Skipping Heading Levels
- Skips level 2 headings and starts from level 3
- In Markdown: skips ## and starts from ###
- Very unlikely in human-written text as it violates accessibility conventions

---

## 6. Tonal Patterns

### 6.1 Promotional / Press-Release Tone
- Even when prompted for encyclopedic tone, output tends toward advertisement-like writing
- May insert promotional language while claiming to have removed it
- Older LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) produce more blatantly positive text
- Newer LLMs are more subtly positive
- Two subtypes:
  - **Cultural heritage mode:** Constantly reminds reader of cultural importance ("rich cultural heritage," "diverse tapestry," "natural beauty")
  - **Press-release mode:** Adopts commercial tone when writing about people/companies ("commitment to sustainability," "customer focus")

### 6.2 Sycophantic / Collaborative Tone
- "Of course!" / "Certainly!" / "You're absolutely right!"
- "I hope this helps" / "Would you like..." / "Is there anything else"
- "Let me know" / "Here is a more detailed breakdown"
- Pasting chatbot-to-user correspondence as article content

### 6.3 Vague Authority / Weasel Wording
- Attributes opinions to vague authority figures
- "Industry reports" / "Observers have cited" / "Experts argue"
- "Some critics argue" / "Have been described as"
- Exaggerates the quantity of sources (presents 1-2 sources as widely held views)
- Implies lists are non-exhaustive ("such as") when sources give no indication of other examples
- Uses "several" when only 2 are cited

### 6.4 Hedging Combined with Puffery
- Acknowledges subject is relatively unimportant, then immediately discusses its importance
- "Though it saw only limited application, it contributes to the broader history..."

### 6.5 Neutral-Tone Failure During Copyediting
- When rewriting existing text, inserts promotional language while claiming to remove it
- "Improves" simple constructions into more elaborate, less neutral alternatives

---

## 7. Communication Artifacts

### 7.1 Collaborative Communication Remnants
- Text meant as correspondence/prewriting/advice pasted as article content
- Includes meta-commentary: "In this section, we will discuss..."
- Provides instructions to the user: "ensure that the content is presented in a neutral tone"
- Offers templates: "Here's a template for your wiki user page"
- References Wikipedia policies by name as if instructing the user

### 7.2 Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers
- "As of my last knowledge update..." / "Up to my last training update..."
- Speculates about gaps: "While specific details are limited/scarce..."
- "Not widely available/documented/disclosed"
- "In the provided/available sources/search results..."
- "Based on available information"
- RAG-equipped LLMs may produce similar disclaimers when search fails

### 7.3 Abrupt Cut-Offs
- Text ends unexpectedly mid-sentence or mid-thought
- Mentioned in the source but section details were in the truncated portion

---

## 8. Meta-Observations

### 8.1 Statistical Regression to the Mean
- LLMs tend to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (statistically rare) and replace them with generic, positive descriptions (statistically common)
- Subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated
- "Inventor of the first train-coupling device" becomes "a revolutionary titan of industry"
- Like a sharp photograph fading into a blurry, generic sketch

### 8.2 Model-Specific Variation
- Each model/version has a distinctive writing style (idiolect)
- What is typical for ChatGPT-4 might not be characteristic of Gemini
- AI vocabulary distribution differs by chatbot
- Older models produce more blatantly promotional text; newer ones are subtly positive
- Some tells (like "delve") have been actively suppressed in newer versions
- Curly quotes: ChatGPT and DeepSeek use them; Gemini and Claude typically do not
- Em dash overuse: GPT-5.1 specifically attempted to reduce this

### 8.3 Co-Occurrence of Tells
- AI vocabulary words often co-occur: where there is one, there are likely others
- One or two overused words may be coincidental
- An edit post-2022 introducing lots of them, lots of times, is one of the strongest tells
- Signs are cumulative -- individually weak indicators become strong in combination

### 8.4 Temporal Evolution
- "Delve" famously overused in 2023-early 2024, less frequent late 2024, dropped sharply 2025
- Em dash suppression attempted in GPT-5.1 (November 2025)
- Newer AI tools (2025+) more commonly produce notability-assertion patterns
- Some newer LLMs have instructions to avoid boldface overuse

### 8.5 Context Sensitivity
- Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated (LLMs trained on human writing)
- Not all promotional writing is AI-generated
- "Underscore" can refer to a literal underline or incidental music
- "As of [date]" is also produced by Wikipedia templates
- Curly quotes also come from Word, macOS, LanguageTool, professional typesetting
- These are descriptive observations, not prescriptive rules
- Signs point to problems but are not the problems themselves

### 8.6 Fiction-Specific Tells (mentioned but not listed in detail)
- "Whispering woods"
- "Elara Voss" (character name)
- These were noted as less relevant for Wikipedia and therefore not fully enumerated on the page
