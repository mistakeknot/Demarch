# Create 9 Plugin Child Beads: Philosophy Alignment

Date: 2026-02-27

## Task

Create 9 child beads for the philosophy alignment epic, one per plugin in the Interverse ecosystem. Each bead covers reading the plugin's vision/roadmap docs and aligning them with root `PHILOSOPHY.md`.

## Results

All 9 beads created successfully from `/home/mk/projects/Demarch`.

| # | Plugin | Bead ID | Priority | Focus Area |
|---|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| 1 | interflux | iv-1o2x9 | P2 | Disagreement-as-signal, composition over capability, multi-model diversity |
| 2 | intermap | iv-ytuic | P2 | Codebase mapping plugin alignment |
| 3 | interkasten | iv-qstl3 | P2 | Documentation-as-memory and evidence principles |
| 4 | tldr-swinton | iv-p9pjj | P2 | Efficiency=quality and measurement principles |
| 5 | tool-time | iv-2dsfu | P2 | Measurement and self-building principles |
| 6 | interlock | iv-zxn3j | P2 | Scoped authority and composition principles |
| 7 | interlearn | iv-zfwny | P2 | Evidence production and documentation-as-memory |
| 8 | interchart | iv-fav6x | P3 | Composition visibility |
| 9 | interject | iv-2h2a7 | P3 | Measurement and disagreement-as-signal; vision doc may need rewrite |

## Key Findings

1. **7 P2 beads, 2 P3 beads** — interchart and interject are lower priority; interject also has a flagged issue that its vision doc may contain research content rather than a standard vision doc and may require a rewrite before alignment work.

2. **Common alignment themes** across plugins: measurement/evidence production, composition principles, disagreement-as-signal (especially for review/discovery plugins), and documentation-as-memory (especially for learning/knowledge plugins).

3. **tldr-swinton has the deepest artifact set** (15 brainstorms, 53 plans) making it the highest-effort alignment task despite sharing P2 priority with others.
