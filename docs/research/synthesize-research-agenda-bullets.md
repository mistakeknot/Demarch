# Research Agenda Synthesis

## Thematic Research Bullets

- **Lens-driven agent review (linsenkasten)** — FLUX podcast cognitive augmentation lenses for agent evaluation, MCP integration, severity classification, and phase-specific agent selection

- **Sprint resilience and kernel handoff** — Resume tracking, fault tolerance, multi-layer rollback recovery, and bidirectional bead↔kernel sync to migrate sprint state to intercore kernel

- **Token efficiency and cost-aware dispatch** — Lazy skill loading, token budget controls per sprint, dispatch cost tracking, and write-behind for subagent context results

- **Document slicing and context compression** — Per-agent section filtering via interserve, import-graph compression, block compression, precomputed context bundles, and symbol-popularity indexing

- **Intercore kernel evolution (E3→E8)** — Hook cutover for sprint state, spawn handler wiring, discovery pipeline for kernel-native research intake, and portfolio orchestration across projects

- **Multi-session agent coordination** — Merge review for multi-agent sessions, hierarchical dispatch meta-agent, session-start drift summary injection, and autonomous sync mechanics

- **Plugin ecosystem and synergy** — Dual-mode architecture (standalone + integrated), cross-plugin interoperability catalog, plugin-synergy discovery, and unified interbus central integration mesh

- **Portfolio and dependency scheduling** — Cross-project portfolio runs with parent-child linking, dependency-aware phase scheduling, TOCTOU guards, and portfolio relay patterns

- **Dashboard and visualization** — Bigend TUI kernel state migration, autarch status tool validation, interchart D3 force graph ecosystem diagram, and tui-kernel validation patterns

- **Event-driven phase advancement** — Automatic phase transition dispatch, event-driven run progression, terminal status exhaustiveness, and gate check flow

- **Thematic sprint organization** — Label-based work lanes for sequencing, shift-work boundary formalization, blueprint distillation sprint intake, and role-aware memory experiments

- **Framework and context optimization** — Multi-framework interoperability benchmarking, repository-aware benchmark expansion, context freshness automation via interwatch, and reminder escalation patterns

- **Advanced state management** — Hierarchical config resolution for model routing, static routing tables, drift detection summaries, and bias-aware product decision frameworks

- **Code extraction and tools** — Interscribe symbol extraction, structured output serialization, longcodezip block compression, and advanced TUI automation with tuivision patterns
