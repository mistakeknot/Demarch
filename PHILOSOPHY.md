# Interverse Philosophy

## Purpose
Interverse is the physical multi-repo ecosystem for the inter-* platform: Clavain hub, companion plugins, shared infrastructure, and services that collectively support disciplined agentic software development.

## North Star
Build Interverse as a coherent multi-repo platform: strong module boundaries, reliable orchestration, and measurable gains in reasoning quality, coordination safety, and token efficiency.

## Working Priorities
- Module boundaries
- Coordination safety
- Outcome efficiency

## Brainstorming Doctrine
1. Start from outcomes and failure modes, not implementation details.
2. Generate at least three options: conservative, balanced, and aggressive.
3. Explicitly call out assumptions, unknowns, and dependency risk across modules.
4. Prefer ideas that improve clarity, reversibility, and operational visibility.

## Planning Doctrine
1. Convert selected direction into small, testable, reversible slices.
2. Define acceptance criteria, verification steps, and rollback path for each slice.
3. Sequence dependencies explicitly and keep integration contracts narrow.
4. Reserve optimization work until correctness and reliability are proven.

## Decision Filters
- Does this reduce ambiguity for future sessions?
- Does this improve reliability without inflating cognitive load?
- Is the change observable, measurable, and easy to verify?
- Can we revert safely if assumptions fail?
