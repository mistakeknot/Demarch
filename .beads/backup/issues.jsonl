When SubmitInput() returns nil (not a slash command), extract text and call chatHandler.HandleMessage(ctx, text)\n2. HandleMessage returns \u003c-chan StreamEvent — wrap in a recursive tea.Cmd (waitForStreamEvent) that reads one event, converts to tea.Msg, and re-invokes itself until channel closes\n3.

Render the full accumulated text each frame (glamour from iv-7do). Cache invalidation happens when new chunk arrives (clearCache pattern).\n\nImplementation:\n1. chatMessage struct: role, content (accumulated), rendered (cached), width, height — mirrors Crush's cachedMessageItem\n2. AddStreamChunk(text): append to current message content, clearCache()\n3. SetState(ChatState): update visual indicator (spinner from iv-5wx when Thinking, streaming dots when Streaming)\n4. Auto-scroll: during streaming, keep viewport pinned to bottom\n5. CancelStream(): views call on tab switch (per design decision Q4), sends context cancel\n6.

No conversation history — structured context beats raw history for single-turn queries.\n\nSystem prompt template:\n  You are a spec assistant for the Gurgeh PRD tool.

Cache rendered output keyed by (content hash + width) — mirrors Crush's cachedMessageItem pattern. Re-render only when content changes or width changes.\n4. Only render agent/system messages through glamour — user messages stay plain (they're short input text)\n5. Integrate with ChatPanel: when rendering message history, call RenderMarkdown for assistant role messages\n6. Handle streaming gracefully: during active streaming, render accumulated text through glamour on each chunk. The cache invalidation (clearCache on new chunk) ensures fresh rendering.

The lifecycle becomes: Discover → Design → Build → Ship → Reflect.\n\n### 10-Phase Chain\nbrainstorm → brainstorm-reviewed → strategized → planned → executing → review → polish → reflect → done\n\n### Gate Rule\nAt least one learning artifact required. Any of: solution doc (docs/solutions/), auto-memory update, skill/prompt improvement, complexity calibration note. The kernel checks 'artifact exists for reflect phase' — the OS defines what qualifies.\n\n### Scaling\nAlways required at all complexity levels.

`allow|deny|require_human`\n  - `reason_code`\n  - `evidence_refs[]`\n- `interhub` presents approval UI for `require_human` and writes decision via command API.\n\n## Error + Compatibility Contract\n- Error envelope:\n  - `code`, `message`, `retryable`, `details`, `trace_id`.\n- Versioning:\n  - Additive fields are backward-compatible.\n  - Breaking changes require `/v2` endpoint and event `schema_version` bump.\n  - `interhub` must ignore unknown fields.\n\n## Non-Goals (v1)\n- No direct plugin-to-UI coupling.\n- No UI-owned business rules.\n- No cross-run global ordering guarantees.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria for this contract phase\n- Interhub can render: portfolio, project control room, agent fleet, exceptions solely from intercore APIs/events.\n- Human gate approvals flow end-to-end using `decision.required` -\u003e command -\u003e `decision.resolved`.\n- A module can be swapped/disabled without interhub code changes if event/API contract remains valid.\n\n## Desired Destination State\n- `intercore` is the platform kernel for autonomous orchestration across tools, not a Claude Code-only plugin bundle.\n- `interhub` is a separate lifecycle UX component (Slack-like TUI/control room) that ships by default with `intercore` but remains replaceable.\n- `inter-*` modules remain composable, generalized capabilities that integrate through `intercore` contracts.\n- `clavain` is the opinionated rig/profile on top of generalized modules (presets, policies, defaults), not the platform kernel.\n- The system supports portfolio-scale operation: multiple agents across multiple projects through one lifecycle control plane from brainstorm to ship.\n\n## OpenClaw-Inspired Direction (Adapted for Interverse)\nThe target architecture is inspired by OpenClaw-style platform patterns while remaining Interverse-native:\n- Manifest-first plugin model with strict schema validation at load time.\n- Explicit plugin capability boundaries and ownership semantics (including optional exclusive slot ownership where needed).\n- Headless control plane + optional/default UX clients.\n- Runtime adapters so Claude Code is one client, not a hard dependency.\n- Event-driven orchestration with deterministic policy decisions and auditable state transitions.\n- Clear separation between platform substrate (`intercore`), capabilities (`inter-*`), and product opinion (`clavain`).\n\n## Why This Matters\n- Reduces coupling to any single AI host runtime.\n- Increases autonomy for long-running multi-agent workflows.\n- Preserves module composability while allowing strong opinionated distributions.\n- Enables future clients (CLI/web/TUI/other hosts) to share the same orchestration kernel.\n\n## Explicit Non-Goals for This Direction\n- `interhub` is not a source of truth for workflow state; `intercore` remains authoritative.\n- `clavain` is not merged into `intercore` and does not bypass platform contracts.\n- This is not a single mega-plugin merge of all inter modules into one inseparable artifact.","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"iv-byh3","is_template":0,"issue_type":"decision","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"Architecture decision complete (design doc populated).

This is 'early stopping' for agent dispatch. Current system launches everything regardless of whether findings warrant full coverage. Expected savings: 30-50% on easy/clean reviews where top 2-3 agents find nothing concerning.

Modify: `modules/core/output_formats.py`\n- **Deterministic slice ordering**: Sort ALL slices by `(file_path, symbol_id)` not relevance\n  - Relevance-based ordering changes between calls → cache miss\n  - Move relevance info to metadata field instead\n- **Stable header template**: Fixed preamble with project name, commit SHA, timestamp\n  - Must be byte-identical across calls for same project state\n  - Template: `\"## Context for {project} @ {commit_sha}\\n\\n\"`\n- **Prefix-first layout**:\n  ```\n  [STABLE HEADER — identical every call]\n  [UNCHANGED SYMBOLS — sorted by ID, signature only]\n  \u003c!-- CACHE_BREAKPOINT: {byte_offset} tokens:{token_count} --\u003e\n  [CHANGED SYMBOLS — sorted by relevance, full code]\n  [STATS FOOTER]\n  ```\n- **Cache hint metadata**: Emit JSON metadata block with:\n  - `cache_prefix_tokens`: token count of stable prefix\n  - `cache_prefix_hash`: SHA256 of prefix content\n  - `breakpoint_offset`: character offset of breakpoint\n  - Purpose: downstream tools can set Anthropic `cache_control` at exact breakpoint\n\n### 2. Modify: `modules/core/contextpack_engine.py`\n- Add `cache_stats` to ContextPack (already has the field, populate it):\n  - `prefix_tokens`, `dynamic_tokens`, `prefix_hash`\n- Compute during `build_context_pack()` or `build_context_pack_delta()`\n\n### 3. Modify: `cli.py`\n- `--format cache-friendly` already exists — ensure it's documented\n- Add `--cache-hints` flag to emit metadata block (useful for programmatic consumers)\n- In `--format json` mode, include cache stats in top-level JSON\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Add cache-friendly format to `docs/agent-workflow.md`\n- Include example showing how to use with Anthropic API `cache_control` blocks\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: verify output is byte-identical for same project state across repeated calls\n- Unit test: verify cache_prefix_tokens matches actual token count\n- Eval: measure prefix stability across 10 sequential calls with small changes\n\n## Dependencies\n- None (builds on existing _format_cache_friendly)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n- Very low risk — purely additive formatting change\n- Backwards compatible: only activates with `--format cache-friendly`","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"iv-r00v","is_template":0,"issue_type":"feature","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"sma@anthropic.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":null,"status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Output templating for LLM provider prompt caching optimization","updated_at":"2026-02-10T01:15:57Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":"mutex"}

Applied to ARC-AGI-2, it triples open-weight model performance (Kimi K2.5: 12.1% → 34.0%) and pushes Gemini 3.1 Pro to 95.1%. Framework is general enough to optimize arbitrary code, prompts, or agents.\n\nRelevance to Demarch:\n- Population-level resilience over individual precision — maps to autonomous agent strategy evolution\n- Soft scoring for gradual improvement — applicable to agent evaluation\n- Learning log for cross-organism knowledge sharing — maps to solution compounding\n- Verification filter pattern — cheap pre-check before expensive evaluation\n- Crossover mutations — combining strategies from different agents\n- Model routing/mixing — already a Clavain concern\n\nPrimary Demarch targets: os/clavain, core/intercore, interverse/interflux, apps/autarch\nResearch topics: evolutionary optimization, LLM-driven code mutation, population dynamics, test-time compute scaling, ARC-AGI-2\n\nKey transferable patterns:\n1. Organism/Evaluator/Mutator abstraction — clean 3-component interface for any optimization problem\n2. Sigmoid-weighted parent selection with novelty bonus — balances exploit vs explore\n3. Learning log with neighborhood strategies — cross-organism knowledge sharing\n4. Post-mutation verification filter — reject trivial/unchanged mutations before expensive eval\n5. Soft scoring with baseline rescaling — enables gradual fitness improvement\n6. Multi-provider LLM mixing — diversity in mutation strategies\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- [ ] Review document complete (done: docs/research/imbue-darwinian-evolver-arc-agi-2-review-2026-02-27.md)\n- [ ] Child beads created for each integration opportunity\n- [ ] Each child produces an assessment with adopt/adapt/inspire/avoid verdict","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"iv-ymm3i","is_template":0,"issue_type":"epic","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"mistakeknot@users.noreply.github.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":1,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"[research] Imbue Darwinian Evolver: evolutionary LLM optimization framework — integration assessment","updated_at":"2026-02-28T05:20:24Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
