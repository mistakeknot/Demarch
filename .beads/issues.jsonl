When SubmitInput() returns nil (not a slash command), extract text and call chatHandler.HandleMessage(ctx, text)\n2. HandleMessage returns <-chan StreamEvent — wrap in a recursive tea.Cmd (waitForStreamEvent) that reads one event, converts to tea.Msg, and re-invokes itself until channel closes\n3. Map StreamEvent variants to ChatPanel methods: TextDelta→AddStreamChunk, ReasoningStart→SetState(Thinking), StreamDone→SetState(Idle), StreamError→SetState(Error)\n4. On Blur (tab switch): cancel active context, call chatPanel.CancelStream() — per design decision Q4\n5.

{"id":"iv-1tm","title":"Add ChatPanel streaming state — SetState, AddStreamChunk, thinking indicator","description":"Extend ChatPanel (pkg/tui/chatpanel.go) with streaming state support. Adopt two critical patterns from Crush:\n\nPattern 1 — Render caching (Crush cachedMessageItem, /tmp/reference/crush/internal/ui/chat/messages.go:131-165):\nEach rendered message is cached by width. getCachedRender(width) returns cached string+height if width matches. clearCache() called on message update. This prevents re-rendering unchanged messages on every View() call.\n\nPattern 2 — Full-message-snapshot rendering (Crush assistant.go RawRender):\nDuring streaming, accumulate chunks into a complete message string. Render the full accumulated text each frame (glamour from iv-7do). Cache invalidation happens when new chunk arrives (clearCache pattern).\n\nImplementation:\n1. chatMessage struct: role, content (accumulated), rendered (cached), width, height — mirrors Crush's cachedMessageItem\n2.

Apply via tree-sitter AST traversal for precision (not regex). Impact: 15-30% savings on code bodies, especially well-documented Python.

`allow|deny|require_human`\n  - `reason_code`\n  - `evidence_refs[]`\n- `interhub` presents approval UI for `require_human` and writes decision via command API.\n\n## Error + Compatibility Contract\n- Error envelope:\n  - `code`, `message`, `retryable`, `details`, `trace_id`.\n- Versioning:\n  - Additive fields are backward-compatible.\n  - Breaking changes require `/v2` endpoint and event `schema_version` bump.\n  - `interhub` must ignore unknown fields.\n\n## Non-Goals (v1)\n- No direct plugin-to-UI coupling.\n- No UI-owned business rules.\n- No cross-run global ordering guarantees.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria for this contract phase\n- Interhub can render: portfolio, project control room, agent fleet, exceptions solely from intercore APIs/events.\n- Human gate approvals flow end-to-end using `decision.required` -> command -> `decision.resolved`.\n- A module can be swapped/disabled without interhub code changes if event/API contract remains valid.\n\n## Desired Destination State\n- `intercore` is the platform kernel for autonomous orchestration across tools, not a Claude Code-only plugin bundle.\n- `interhub` is a separate lifecycle UX component (Slack-like TUI/control room) that ships by default with `intercore` but remains replaceable.\n- `inter-*` modules remain composable, generalized capabilities that integrate through `intercore` contracts.\n- `clavain` is the opinionated rig/profile on top of generalized modules (presets, policies, defaults), not the platform kernel.\n- The system supports portfolio-scale operation: multiple agents across multiple projects through one lifecycle control plane from brainstorm to ship.\n\n## OpenClaw-Inspired Direction (Adapted for Interverse)\nThe target architecture is inspired by OpenClaw-style platform patterns while remaining Interverse-native:\n- Manifest-first plugin model with strict schema validation at load time.\n- Explicit plugin capability boundaries and ownership semantics (including optional exclusive slot ownership where needed).\n- Headless control plane + optional/default UX clients.\n- Runtime adapters so Claude Code is one client, not a hard dependency.\n- Event-driven orchestration with deterministic policy decisions and auditable state transitions.\n- Clear separation between platform substrate (`intercore`), capabilities (`inter-*`), and product opinion (`clavain`).\n\n## Why This Matters\n- Reduces coupling to any single AI host runtime.\n- Increases autonomy for long-running multi-agent workflows.\n- Preserves module composability while allowing strong opinionated distributions.\n- Enables future clients (CLI/web/TUI/other hosts) to share the same orchestration kernel.\n\n## Explicit Non-Goals for This Direction\n- `interhub` is not a source of truth for workflow state; `intercore` remains authoritative.\n- `clavain` is not merged into `intercore` and does not bypass platform contracts.\n- This is not a single mega-plugin merge of all inter modules into one inseparable artifact.","acceptance_criteria":"- Destination-state architecture (intercore/interhub/inter-modules/clavain) is documented and decision-complete\n- intercore↔interhub API + event bus contract is documented with versioning and compatibility rules\n- Responsibilities and boundaries are explicit (no UI source-of-truth, no Clavain bypass of platform contracts)\n- Phased rollout/migration plan is documented with risks and rollback strategy\n- Module composability is preserved while enabling default-shipped lifecycle UX","notes":"Architecture decision complete (design doc populated).

Findings: (1) Signal broker process model undefined — daemon vs embedded, and creates a contradiction where 'durable consumers' read from a non-durable broker instead of the kernel event log. The broker is described as both a 'real-time projection' (ephemeral) and a delivery mechanism for durable consumers (persistent). Cursor semantics, reconnect behavior, and security/auth model are all missing. (2) pkg/tui: no versioning policy, dependency boundaries, test strategy, keymap conventions, accessibility constraints.

Use type signature and call pattern to prune: if a function's signature fully describes its contract (e.g., def is_valid(x: str) -> bool), its callers don't need code bodies. If a callee is well-known stdlib/framework, omit entirely. If multiple callers have identical call patterns, show one exemplar + count. Group callers by call-site pattern and deduplicate.

Native YAML pushes it to agents. Decision needed: which approach better suits the overall system?

Impact: 50-90% cost savings via provider caching on unchanged portion. Effort: Low. Risk: Very low — purely additive.","design":"# Implementation Plan: Output Templating for Prompt Caching Optimization\n\n## Goal\nPolish and fully integrate `_format_cache_friendly()` so tldrs output maximizes LLM provider prompt cache hit rates (Anthropic 90% savings, OpenAI 50%).\n\n## Current State\n`_format_cache_friendly()` in output_formats.py (~80% done) already:\n- Separates unchanged symbols (cache prefix) from changed (dynamic)\n- Sorts unchanged by stable symbol ID (deterministic ordering)\n- Emits a `<!-- CACHE_BREAKPOINT -->` marker\n\n## Remaining Work\n\n### 1. Modify: `modules/core/output_formats.py`\n- **Deterministic slice ordering**: Sort ALL slices by `(file_path, symbol_id)` not relevance\n  - Relevance-based ordering changes between calls → cache miss\n  - Move relevance info to metadata field instead\n- **Stable header template**: Fixed preamble with project name, commit SHA, timestamp\n  - Must be byte-identical across calls for same project state\n  - Template: `\"## Context for {project} @ {commit_sha}\\n\\n\"`\n- **Prefix-first layout**:\n  ```\n  [STABLE HEADER — identical every call]\n  [UNCHANGED SYMBOLS — sorted by ID, signature only]\n  <!-- CACHE_BREAKPOINT: {byte_offset} tokens:{token_count} -->\n  [CHANGED SYMBOLS — sorted by relevance, full code]\n  [STATS FOOTER]\n  ```\n- **Cache hint metadata**: Emit JSON metadata block with:\n  - `cache_prefix_tokens`: token count of stable prefix\n  - `cache_prefix_hash`: SHA256 of prefix content\n  - `breakpoint_offset`: character offset of breakpoint\n  - Purpose: downstream tools can set Anthropic `cache_control` at exact breakpoint\n\n### 2. Modify: `modules/core/contextpack_engine.py`\n- Add `cache_stats` to ContextPack (already has the field, populate it):\n  - `prefix_tokens`, `dynamic_tokens`, `prefix_hash`\n- Compute during `build_context_pack()` or `build_context_pack_delta()`\n\n### 3. Modify: `cli.py`\n- `--format cache-friendly` already exists — ensure it's documented\n- Add `--cache-hints` flag to emit metadata block (useful for programmatic consumers)\n- In `--format json` mode, include cache stats in top-level JSON\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- Add cache-friendly format to `docs/agent-workflow.md`\n- Include example showing how to use with Anthropic API `cache_control` blocks\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: verify output is byte-identical for same project state across repeated calls\n- Unit test: verify cache_prefix_tokens matches actual token count\n- Eval: measure prefix stability across 10 sequential calls with small changes\n\n## Dependencies\n- None (builds on existing _format_cache_friendly)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n- Very low risk — purely additive formatting change\n- Backwards compatible: only activates with `--format cache-friendly`","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"sma@anthropic.com","created_at":"2026-02-09T18:12:37Z","created_by":"Steve Yegge","updated_at":"2026-02-10T01:15:57Z","closed_at":"2026-02-10T01:15:57Z","close_reason":"Implemented: prefix maximization, cache hints JSON, non-delta fix, cache_stats everywhere, full test suite (277 tests passing)"}
