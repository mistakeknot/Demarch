{"id":"iv-xweh","title":"Formalize interactive-to-autonomous shift-work boundary in workflows","description":"Inspired by StrongDM's Shift Work technique. Clavain's /lfg already separates interactive (brainstorm, plan) from autonomous (execute) phases, but the boundary is implicit. Formalize this: (1) define 'spec completeness' criteria — plan approved, tests defined, acceptance criteria written (2) auto-detect when spec is complete and suggest switching to autonomous mode (3) document the pattern in using-clavain. Also consider: clodex-toggle is a manual version of this — could be triggered automatically when spec completeness is detected.","design":"docs/research/shift-work-boundary.md","notes":"Flux-drive review complete (2026-02-11). Needs most design iteration. Key issues: (1) collapse autonomous into clodex toggle, not new flag, (2) batch=min(ALL,10) ceiling for context safety, (3) grep heuristics too fragile — use section headers or human-confirmed checklist, (4) add pause escape hatch + mandatory incremental commits. Ship last of the three.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"mistakeknot@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T11:06:29.757480765-08:00","created_by":"mk","updated_at":"2026-02-11T13:33:36.616526057-08:00"}
